# Beat Saber Map Analysis

This is a web application that provides a comprehensive interface for statistical analysis of Beat Saber maps.

## Getting Started

The **OST/DLC** dataset is available by default from within the application. You can use the controls at the top-right of the Overview/Data pages to freely override a built-in dataset with new metadata, or likewise refresh the dataset to pull the latest updates from the repository.

**We currently don't have plans to support any additional built-in datasets at this time**, but you're welcome to share any custom datasets you've made in the corresponding [Discussions](https://github.com/officialMECH/bs-analysis/discussions/categories/community-datasets) feed.

If you'd like to create your own datasets, [generator scripts](./scripts/README.md) are available which will allow you to create a dataset from a multitude of sources through the command line. Support for generating datasets in-app will be available in the near future.

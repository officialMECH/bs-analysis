# Beat Saber Map Analysis

This is a web application that provides a comprehensive interface for statistical analysis of Beat Saber maps.

## Getting Started

The **OST/DLC** dataset is available by default from within the application. You can use the controls at the top-right of the Overview/Data pages to freely override the contents of any built-in dataset, or likewise refresh the dataset to pull the latest updates from this repository.

**We currently don't have plans to support any additional built-in datasets**, but you're welcome to share any custom datasets you've made in the corresponding [Discussions](https://github.com/officialMECH/bs-analysis/discussions/categories/community-datasets) feed.

You can also create and modify your own _custom datasets_ from directly within the application, or alternatively use the provided [generator scripts](./scripts) to generate a custom dataset from a variety of external sources, such as local files and external spreadsheets.

# Beat Saber Map Analysis

This is a web application which provides a comprehensive interface for statistical analysis of Beat Saber maps.

## Getting Started

A live deployment and related documentation will be available soonâ„¢.

The OST/DLC dataset will be added following the next content update for Beat Saber, and will be natively accessible from within the application by default.

If you'd like to create your own datasets, [generator scripts](./scripts/README.md) are available which will allow you to create a dataset from a multitude of sources through the command line. Support for generating datasets in-app will be available in the near future.
